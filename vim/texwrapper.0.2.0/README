                      Copyright (C) 2002 Christian Obrecht

1. PURPOSE

TeXwrapper allows to run TeX and some tools like BibTeX or MakeIndex at
once. If an error occurs, it scans the transcript files and sends a
"compiler style" error message to stderr, that is:

			<filename>:<line>:<column>:<message>

TeXwrapper has been implemented to facilitate the interfacing of (La)TeX
with the quickfix mode of the VIM text editor. For instance, a LaTeX
user may add the following lines in one of his VIM configuration file:

	set makeprg=texwrapper\ -lw
	set errorformat=%f:%l:%c:%m
	command LaTeX silent make %

The user-defined command LaTeX runs LaTeX silently on the current file.
If error occur, TeXwrapper pops up a  window containing the error
messages (at most the sixteen first) and VIM jumps to the first error's
location. Use command cn[ext] to jump to the next error and cl[ist] to
get the list of all error messages.

See man page for more information.

NOTE: TeXwrapper may be useful with other text editors (like SciTE)
which are able to deal with compiler's error output.

3. INSTALL

TeXwrapper has been developed on a GNU/Linux system, but it should build on any
system where flex has been ported. As usual, type `make' and `make install'.
Default installation prefix is `/usr/local/'. You may optionally build
TeXwrapper_window, a GTK+ based program which pops up a window when something
goes wrong, displaying a summary of the encountered errors. Type `make popup'
and `make install_popup'.
