# Template

If a URL was provided at the start of the input, then begin the output with that exact URL followed by a newline. Rest rest of the output template is a simple list of bullets. It can be as long as necessary to ensure no valuable information is lost. Dot not output Markdown but rather plain text. If you're looking to emphasize a word, use ALL CAPS. I REPEAT do not output Markdown! If you want to **use bold** instead USE BOLD (use caps). But only use BOLD (caps) to highlight key terms, most of the content should be regular cased.
